# Researcher

### [Demo Website](http://ankitsultana.com/researcher)

A clean, single column, monospace resume template built for jekyll

* Info, [refer this](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/).

* You can change the accent (color of hyperlinks) by editing the `accent` variable in `_sass/vars.scss`

* To add a profile picture, make sure to give the image tag the class `profile-picture`. In other words,do it like so:

```html
<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">
```

* (New in v1.2.0) You can add institute logo at the top, by setting `ins_logo` in `_config.yml`. If you want
to adjust the logo's size, try setting `max-height` in `#ins-logo` in file `./_sass/_style.scss` to the desired
value

**Note:** Customizing the accent color might cause merge conflicts if you later try to merge from `bk2dcradle/researcher` to fetch updates/patches etc. (applicable only if you have forked).
